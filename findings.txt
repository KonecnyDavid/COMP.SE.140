Containers share kernel and system resources with the host. Unlike virtual 
machines, the containers leverage the host's kernel for system calls and 
resource access. This makes containers more efficient and faster to start and 
stop, making them more lightweight than virtual machines. 

Containers can also be configured to share the same network interface with the 
host. Sharing the same network interface with the host may allow them to share 
the host's IP address. 

Containers can also share volumes with the host to ensure data persistence and 
facilitate data exchange between the host and containers. By mounting volume to 
a container, data can persist across restarts or even deletion of the 
container. 

Containers can also be given permission to access host devices such as GPUs and 
USB devices. This enables the sharing of particular hardware resources from the 
hosts to the containers, allowing for efficient utilization of hardware 
resources across the system.
